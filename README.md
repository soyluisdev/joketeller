# Joketeller
## Joketeller is a JavaScript project that combines a joke API with the VoiceRSS SDK to create a fun and interactive experience.

### How It Works
Joke API: The project uses the Joke API (https://v2.jokeapi.dev/) to fetch random jokes. This API provides a wide range of jokes, including programming, general, and other categories.

VoiceRSS SDK: To bring the jokes to life, Joketeller integrates with VoiceRSS (https://voicerss.org/), a text-to-speech service. This SDK converts the text of the jokes into spoken words, allowing users to hear the jokes read aloud.

### Features
Random Joke Generation: The project fetches jokes from the Joke API and presents them randomly.
Text-to-Speech: Using VoiceRSS, it converts the joke text into speech, so you can listen to the jokes instead of just reading them.
Interactive: Provides an engaging way to enjoy jokes through audio, making it a fun and dynamic tool for users.
Joketeller is a great example of combining APIs and SDKs to create a unique and enjoyable user experience.
